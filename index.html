    <p>Hi. This is a website where you can buy me pizza. Thanks.</p>
    <p>This domain edwin.pizza costs me $40 per year, which is half as much as I pay for edwin.xxx but still like 2–4 pizzas worth of cash.</p>
    <p>I’m charging $15 for a medium cheese. That’s a pretty good deal b/c I’m paying the tax and tip myself, and I live in Brooklyn which means pizza costs like $30. Plus integrating this payment shit is hard, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/checkout">read this</a> — very confusing.</p>

    <form action="/charge" method="POST">
      <script
        src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"
        class="stripe-button"
        data-key="pk_test_6pRNASCoBOKtIshFeQd4XMUh"
        data-name="buy.edwin.pizza"
        data-description="medium cheese — $15.00"
        data-amount="1500">

    </form>
 
    <p>The best pizza place is Pauline and Sharon’s, so I’ll probably order from there, but they take an hour to deliver and I only live a mile away — I’m usually desperately hungry when I order pizza so an hour wait is wack. Did you know they charge like $3 more for all their pizzas on Seamless vs. calling? The worst place is definitely Vinny’s, I went in there once to… actually you probably don’t care about this story, but <a href="#">click here if you wanna read it</a>.</p>
    <p>(ok so I was walking around my neighborhood and waiting to meet a friend for a late lunch. I was really hungry though and thought I’d slip a slice before we met up, so I go into the nearest pizza place which happened to by Vinny’s. I sit down to wait for my cheese slice and hear some aggressive yelling, then some old Italian couple comes in from the back. They must have been the owners because they were basically in pajamas and the guy says “bring this woman a slice, she wants a slice” and she says “your wife, I am your wife.” It was awkward because they had clearly just been in a fight and the seating area was very small, so it was just me and them sitting there quietly waiting for pizza. So tense. I’m never going there again, plus the pizza was average at best.)</p>
    <p>Anyways, that money goes into my bank account which I then use to buy and eat a pizza as soon as possible. I’ll take some pics and post them on this website, and maybe I’ll send you a funny email. I think it’s a good deal so you should probably buy me the pizza now.</p>
