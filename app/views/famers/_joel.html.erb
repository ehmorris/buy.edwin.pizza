    <p>Joel I totally forgot to take pizza notes when I ate this pizza. I am sorry. But it was my first in-the-wild edition of pizza timelapses. I did have an idea though that I wrote down: for a tech-heavy version of buy.edwin.pizza, I could wear a go-pro strapped to my head and film my pizza-eating from the first person.</p>
    <p>I also feel a little bad Joel because I ate this pizza in Boston and you live in Boston, so it’s like… why didn’t I eat this pizza *with* you? And that’s fair, and I probably should have, but I also had a very strict schedule of playing GTA V with my old roommate that I had to keep (and this restaurant was only a block away.)</p>
