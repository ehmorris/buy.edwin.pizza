<p>Wow I can’t believe you actually did that lmao.</p>
<p>Alright so you and I are both gonna get emails about this. I’m gonna order the pizza ASAP (could be today, could be a week from now) and prove to you that I bought it. I’m probably gonna take a timelapse video and post that somewhere. I’m gonna write a cute email to you once I’m done eating, and I’ll probably write a review and put it on the website. I’ll let you know when I do that.</p>
<p>I might post something about it on twitter too, so you could <a href="https://twitter.com/ehmorris" target="_blank">watch for it there</a> or on <a href="https://instagram.com/ehmorris" target="_blank">my instagram</a>. Don't follow me though, it would be embarrassing. Just kidding I want you to follow me. I wrote this whole paragraph so you would follow me.</p>
