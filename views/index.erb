  <p>Look, this domain edwin.pizza costs $40 per year, which is half as much as I pay for edwin.xxx but still like 2–4 pizzas worth of cash. I’m trying to make my money back.</p>
  <p>I’m charging $15 for a medium cheese. That’s a pretty good deal b/c I’m paying the tax and tip myself, and I live in Brooklyn which means pizza costs like $30. Plus integrating this payment shit is hard.</p>

  <p>At first I thought I’d let people make a delivery order to my apartment, any time of the day — it was gonna be a social experiment like jennicam. But that’s crazy so instead the money just goes into my bank account (lol.) I’ll buy a whole cheese pizza that costs at least $15 ASAP, then I’ll post pics of me eating it (and the receipt) on this website, and maybe I’ll send you a funny email, and maybe I’ll post a review — the possibilies are endless and I think you and I are the right team to figure it out. You should probably buy me the pizza now.</p>

  <p>Please stop asking me questions and just buy the pizza.</p>

  <p>Fine. The best place is Pauline and Sharon’s, so I’ll probably order from there, but they take an hour to deliver and I only live a mile away. Plus I called them the other day at like 2pm and got this sassy answering machine message talking about “summer hours” and closing early. Ugh. Did you know they charge like $3 more for all their pizzas on Seamless vs. calling? The worst place is definitely Vinny’s, I had a weird experience there and I used to have the story on this website, but I decided to remove it cause it’s uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>Anyways…</p>
