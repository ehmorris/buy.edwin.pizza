    <p>I’m gonna wake up at sunrise tomorrow and travel to Central Park for a walk. I never wake up early, I don’t take advantage of my late-start benefit. Every day that I wake up at 9:30am is wasted. New York is special in the morning, and there’s so much more activity in Manhattan than Carroll Gardens.</p>
    <p><a href="#">I ended up having a lovely walk btw and I tried out a VR headset — this story is slightly off-topic though so you have to click this to read it, yep this whole paragraph, just click it.</a></p>

      <p>Ok so I woke up at 6:40am to take a sunrise walk through central park. The trains run fast in the morning so it only took me 30 minutes to get there — I exited the Columbus Circle station to sun rays and 65 degrees, one of the first beautiful spring mornings. At 8:50am, after walking around for an hour and posting some 'grams, I exited the park and began walking down 5th towards the Rockefeller F station, knowing I had to take the train by 9:45am to be at work on time.</p>
      <p>As I approached the Microsoft store I remembered a month previous when I had gone in and seen someone trying the HTC Vive demo. I didn't try it then because there was an hours-long line of people on a waitlist, but at 9:00am the store had just opened, and there were literally 0 customers inside. I asked them to setup the demo and they began to boot everything up for me.</p>
      <p>Soon I was strapped in and standing underwater on a boat, batting at schools of small fish swimming around my head. The Vive has "room scale" VR means you can walk around in a fairly large space and move within the virtual world — your headset and controllers are tracked with millimeter precision. I was walking around, crouching to inspect details, leaning over railings. The underwater demo ends with a huge blue whale swimming up beside you and taking a moment to look you over before it bats its tail to swim away— it's awe inspiringly huge, and VR makes it possible to feel that. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFKbL-GU-_U">video of this demo</a>)</p>
      <p>The second demo was a shooter game, where one hand was a shield and another was a gun. I was ducking behind my shield, looking forward while I shot sideways over my shoulder, crouching to avoid fire — the whole thing was intuitive and it turns out I'm not a great shot. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIEuB7H9TOE&feature=youtu.be&t=227">video of this demo, including showing the person using the Vive</a>)</p>
      <p>The last demo was a 3D painting application where I painted with light and smoke and 3D oils. It was pretty fun but slightly boring compared with the shooter. I so badly want this thing in my apartment but the cost is so steep, I can see it going the way of Segway.</p>

    <p>Ok so back to pizza. This is gonna be the first pickup-order pizza — gotta save that money since this is a $12 buy (no shade.) Milan told me she likes the grandma slice, so I called up Cotta Bene and ordered a medium grandpa slice… close enough, and it has vodka sauce which I might like even more than ranch. There’s this pizza place called Bay Ridge Pizza which has a preeeetty bad yelp rating but amazing vodka pizza. Every time I go to Bay Ridge I eat there — they cover the entire pie in a layer of vodka sauce, and then completely seal it in with a layer of mozzarella. There’s one younger guy working there who always gets shit from the older guys, I feel bad for him but Jillian insists he’s “weird.”</p>
    <p>Now as I understand it, one of the defining features of the grandparent pizza is being square and having fluffier dough. When I called they said "it's not square ok?" I said ok and they hung up without asking for my name or giving me a wait time. K.</p>
    <p>When I arrived 10 mins later they handed me their normal medium vodka pizza — so I guess the medium grandpa is actually not a grandpa at all. The pizza was also cold. Ugh, fuck Cotta Bene. I had this memory of eating a Cotta Bene grandpa slice at a party but it must have been another place.</p>
    <p>They are now on my shit list. I'm tired and hungry and mad, they were rude on the phone, their grandpa pizza is the same as their vodka pizza (but listed as two separate items on seamless), it’s listed at $13.95 on seamless but somehow cost $15 in cash, and it's cold. I need to send this info out to blogs. Wait I take back my price complaint I just checked the receipt and it was 13.95. But still fuck them.</p>
    <p>At least I got to wear my pizza sweatshirt which is a gift from my sister. Thanks Anna!</p>
