    <p>Chris told me his favorite pizza was some kind of “meat on cheese” well that’s just great Chris because now I’m gonna spend more than $15 but I’ll do it for you. Chris and I just met, we’re <a target="_blank" href="https://briefs.fm/edwin">working on a podcast website</a> together. Chris bought me this pizza within five minutes of meeting me and that makes me feel pretty.</p>
    <p>This pizza is $18 which is actually less than I’ve spent on Domino’s before so I should be fine with it, but something about paying with cash makes it more painful. But don’t feel bad Chris, you went with the full $15 option and I appreciate that. Even if you didn’t realize there was a $12 option which I know you didn’t because we were on a video call together when you bought the pizza and I asked you why you bought the $15 pizza and you were like “what do you mean.” Is that a dark pattern?</p>
    <p>It’s currently 20:21 which is pretty late, and yeah I use 24 hour time but it’s not pretentious or anything let me explain: I used to live in a windowless room in a two bedroom apartment (windowless bedrooms are technically illegal because they only have one entrance/exit which is bad for fires, but this apartment also had a back “den” room connected to the other bedroom, and I think that that was technically the other bedroom and I lived in a technical giant closet, but realistically everyone would call my room the other bedroom) and I would (you still with me?) and I would wake up in total darkness e.g. can’t see your own hand — being a student, I often went to bed at weird hours like 7pm after not sleeping for several days; once I woke up at 9:00, and if you look at your iPhone you’ll notice it doesn’t say AM or PM, so I thought 9:00am and freaked out and burst out of my room in a  panic only to find my roommate watching a movie on the couch at 9:00pm two hours after I went to sleep, so now I use 24 hour time. Anyways it’s pretty late and I’m REAL hungry so hopefully this pizza arrives quickly. I also just had a manic cleaning episode and breathed in some heavy bleach fumes (btw to spell check bleach I just opened Siri on my phone and said “BLEACH” which would be weird to watch someone do) and my fingers smell like bleach, which probably means I shouldn’t be eating food with my hands.</p>
    <p>Not to bring it up three times but this $18 thing is a little annoying, you see, I’ve got a $20, two $10s, and five $1s. Now, I’d like to get rid of these $1s, but it’s not gonna make sense if I give the delivery guy two $10s and five $1s, I’ve gotta give him two $10s and one or two $1s. If this were a $13 pizza (the price of the plain) then I could just dump all my tiny $1s on him. Also, in New York it’s called a plain — I learned this on a pizza tour I took the other week — all pizza has cheese on it — but you know I take issue with that, cause while the cheese may be un-removable from the pizza, it’s still a topping. Also note that people don’t say “plain” when they order a burger, they say a “burger”, or a “cheese burger” which is kinda like listing all the ingredients in the burger even though the burger part is unremovable. Maybe people should say “pepperoni cheese” or “sausage cheese and sauce.” Anyways the pizza tour was great, I expected to hit up a couple good slice places, but instead I learned the entire history of pizza in Italy and America, and my guide was an actual comedian.</p>
    <p>It’s been an hour. Hour and 15 mins now. Will this be the first pizza where I call to ask about my order? Much like the crossing signal button, it has no effect but it’s the only thing I can do. The only time that calling is actually useful is when it’s the worst news: they forgot about your order and haven’t even started yet. Pauline and Sharon’s is 1.4 miles away and it’s been 1.4 hours since I ordered, so it’s possible that my pizza was made and dispatched immediately, but the delivery person is walking, and only at ~1mph.</p>
    <p>Ok I called: “I ordered a sausage an hour and a half ago” — when your statement is immediately answered with “oh he’s on his way” without asking for your address or name, the placebo effect doesn’t work. I will die tonight. I will die. I want to eat the hot dogs in my fridge but I’ve already started this journal.</p>
    <p>I hear a moped motor stopping outside. Ye boi!! That took an hour and 40 minutes. It is incredibly greasy from the meat. Wow. Here I go. There’s a weirdly small amount of cheese on this. Ok here I go for real see you in the video bye.</p>
