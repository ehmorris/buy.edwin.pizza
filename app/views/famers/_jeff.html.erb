    <p>It was gorgeous outside today. When I walk to work I cross exactly three streets, and it takes me around three minutes, which doesn’t leave much time for admiring the weather. When I left the office slightly after sunset I felt a bit depressed by missing such a day — had I still been a student in Boston, I might have taken the train to a quiet spot near the water to relax and spend some time thinking about things and imagining things, I did that often, usually in the <a target="_blank" href="">same quiet spot on the same wharf</a> — instead, since I’m an adult now, I went to the <a target="_blank" href="">bar of an ice cream shop</a> and ordered a single scoop of chocolate in a cup.</p>
    <p>The first time I met Jeff was in the Computer Science lab in <a target="_blank" href="">West Village H</a> at Northeastern, the one on the ground floor; I was with my friend Zane — Zane and I have the same birthday and lived on the same floor in <a target="_blank" href="">Melvin Hall</a> — we were both freshman and Jeff was known for trying to meet interesting freshmen. Jeff approached us as we worked on homework and quickly added us on Facebook via his iPhone as soon as he learned our names — this was two years after the iPhone came out but I still thought they were fancy.</p>
    <p>Jeff took me to the South End for the first time that Spring, to <a target="_blank" href="">Flour Bakery</a> at 8am — they were famous for sticky buns and used to run out of them early. I hadn’t really gone anywhere in the Fall because I was getting used to college, and I didn’t go anywhere in the winter because it was dark and cold all the time, so this was among the first times I had really left campus and behaved like an individual. I had class later in the day and remember being shocked by the suggestion of waking up early, but it was worth it.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed the walk and the neighborhood so much that I went on the exact same walk at least five times in the next few weeks, by myself and sometimes with girls from my dorm. As years went by Jeff took me to my first club (<a target="_blank" href="">Machine</a> and later <a target="_blank" href="">Club Cafe</a>), to my first restaurant dinner in Boston (<a target="_blank" href="">Sonsie</a>), to <a target="_blank" href="">Toscanini</a> for the first time, on my first sailing trip in the Charles, to my <a target="_blank" href="">first MIT party</a>, probably to Harvard for the first time, and likely many more things which I can’t remember.</p>
    <p>When we talked about technology and startups Jeff always seemed to personally know the people involved, so it was inevitable for him to move to San Francisco after graduating. He kept extending invitations to visit, but I was too nervous about spending money and taking time off from a new co-op to plan a trip. After my 21st birthday, I finally booked it, and <a target="_blank" href="">I enjoyed it so much</a> that I’ve been going every year since.</p>
    <p>As another first tonight I created my Domino’s pizza profile. Turns out I could have been getting <em>even more</em> free pizza this entire time. When I ordered I noticed a new drop-down menu (which is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rmudo/dominos_employees_do_you_guys_actually_give_a/c472zqs">not new at all</a>) below the Pizza Tracker which I love so much — it was the “encouragement menu”, which contained a list of some nice and some slightly strange sentences that somehow get broadcast to the people making your pizza — the future is amazing.</p>
