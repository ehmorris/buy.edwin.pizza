  <p>Ok things are a little different this time. Gonna order from Dominos — I don’t have any cash and their “online order timeline” thing is too amazing to pass up. Probably gonna get extravagant here and spend like $25 because you can't order from dominos and not get cinnasticks.</p>
  <p>It’s raining though so I feel a little bad for the delivery guy.</p>
  <p>Almost made a pizza profile.</p>
  <p>I have the Domino’s tracker open in a tab and I started doing other stuff. Very terrifying to hear a random “ALRIGHT! YOU PIZZA IS NOW IN THE OVEN” in the voice of pete the pizzamaker when you don’t expect it.</p>
  <p>Been in “quality check” for almost 20 mins. What is wrong with my pizza.</p>
  <p>Decided to switch to the tropical order tracker theme. Now a parrot tells me “We be quality checking your order man, and it be looking sooo good.”</p>
  <p>The ¾ mark of waiting for a pizza is truly one of the deepest despairs. Anticipation and hunger are at level 10, hope at level 0.</p>
  <p>Ok he came in an Acura so I don't feel too bad.</p>
  <p>I ordered TWO cinnastick sauces but only got ONE. WTF!!!!! That's why I'm pointing to the sauce in the picture.</p>
