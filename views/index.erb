  <p>Look, this domain edwin.pizza costs $40 per year, which is half as much as I pay for edwin.xxx but still like 2–4 pizzas worth of cash. I’m trying to make my money back.</p>
  <p>I’m charging $15 for a medium cheese. That’s a pretty good deal b/c I’m paying the tax and tip myself, and I live in Brooklyn which means pizza costs like $30. Plus integrating this payment shit is hard.</p>

  <p>At first I thought I’d let people make a delivery order to my apartment, any time of the day — it was gonna be a social experiment like jennicam. But that’s crazy so instead the money just goes into my bank account (lol.) I’ll buy a whole cheese pizza that costs at least $15 ASAP, then I’ll post pics of me eating it (and the receipt) on this website, and maybe I’ll send you a funny email, and maybe I’ll post a review — the possibilies are endless and I think you and I are the right team to figure it out. You should probably buy me the pizza now.</p>

  <p>Fine. The best place is Pauline and Sharon’s, so I’ll probably order from there, but they take an hour to deliver and I only live a mile away — I’m usually desperately hungry when I order pizza so an hour wait is nearly unbearable. Did you know they charge like $3 more for all their pizzas on Seamless vs. calling? The worst place is definitely Vinny’s, I went in there once to… actually you probably don’t care about this story, but <a href="#" data-target="vinnys_story">click here if you wanna read it</a>.</p>
  <p data-targetable="vinnys_story">Ok so I was walking around my neighborhood and waiting to meet a friend for a late lunch. I was already really hungry though, so I walked into the nearest pizza place which happened to by Vinny’s. I sit down to wait for my cheese slice and hear some aggressive yelling, then some old Italian couple comes in from the back. They must have been the owners because they were basically in pajamas and the guy says “bring this woman a slice, she wants a slice” and she says “your wife, I am your wife.” It was awkward because they had clearly just been in a fight and the seating area was very small, so it was just me and them sitting there quietly waiting for pizza. So tense. I’m never going there again, plus the pizza was average at best.</p>
